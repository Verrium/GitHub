        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>So <strong>this will be my journey</strong>, reason im interested in coding is you can work from anywhere.</p>

        <!-- do not use <b> or <i> as a shortcut for bold or emphasized letters. -->

        <p>For example, i can be in an <em>entire different country</em> and still manage to work from my laptop or computer.</p>

        <p>i will now name some things off of places i would love to be at while i do coding as an example</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Japan</li>
            <li>Mexico</li>
            <li>Italy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I will also be naming the programs i would love to learn in order while on this joruney for coding.</p>
